# Introducing sprout.js
## A badass HTML5 game library for JavaScript

I've been playing around with the HTML5 Canvas for some time now,
and I've found the JS API to be really cumbersome. For anything but simple
shapes, there's a huge learning curve for anybody not familiar with the
element.

## A dynamic canvas

When one tries to do anything more complicated with the Canvas API, the code
can get ugly quick. In typical DOM manipulation, you can move things around and
the browser will rerender them for you. Unfortunately, the Canvas element is
static - to change anything, you need to cache the objects you are drawing
and rerender them smoothly.

This is where sprout.js starts. I wanted to make the Canvas as simple as
possible while still allowing detailed control. That's just the tip of the
iceberg though :)
