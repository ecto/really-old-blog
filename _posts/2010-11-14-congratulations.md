# Congratulations

To begin with, for you to be here now trillions of drifting atoms
had somehow to assemble in an intricate and intriguingly obliging
manner to create you. It’s an arrangement so specialized and particular
that it has never been tried before and will only exist this
once. For the next many years (we hope) these tiny particles will
uncomplainingly engage in all the billions of deft, cooperative efforts
necessary to keep you intact and let you experience the supremely
agreeable but generally underappreciated state known as existence.
Why atoms take this trouble is a bit of a puzzle. Being you is not a
gratifying experience at the atomic level. For all their devoted attention,
your atoms don’t actually care about you—indeed, don’t even
know that you are there. They don’t even know that they are there.
They are mindless particles, after all, and not even themselves alive.
(It is a slightly arresting notion that if you were to pick yourself apart
with tweezers, one atom at a time, you would produce a mound of
fine atomic dust none of which had ever been alive but all of which
had once been you.) Yet somehow for the period of your existence
they will answer to a single overarching impulse: to keep you you.
The bad news is that atoms are fickle and their time of devotion
is fleeting—fleeting indeed. Even a long human life adds up to only
about 650,000 hours. And when that modest milestone flashes past,
or at some other point thereabouts, for reasons unknown your atoms
will shut you down, silently disassemble, and go off to be other things.
And that’s it for you.

Still, you may rejoice that it happens at all. Generally speaking in
the universe it doesn’t, so far as we can tell. This is decidedly odd
because the atoms that so liberally and congenially flock together to
form living things on Earth are exactly the same atoms that decline
to do it elsewhere. Whatever else it may be, at the level of chemistry
life is curiously mundane: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, a
little calcium, a dash of sulfur, a light dusting of other very ordinary
elements—nothing you wouldn’t find in any ordinary drugstore—
and that’s all you need. The only thing special about the atoms that
make you is that they make you. That is of course the miracle of life.
Whether or not atoms make life in other corners of the universe,
they make plenty else; indeed, they make everything else. Without
them there would be no water or air or rocks, no stars and planets,
no distant gassy clouds or swirling nebulae or any of the other things
that make the universe so usefully material. Atoms are so numerous
and necessary that we easily overlook that they needn’t actually exist
at all. There is no law that requires the universe to fill itself with
small particles of matter or to produce light and gravity and the other
physical properties on which our existence hinges. There needn’t actually
be a universe at all.

So thank goodness for atoms. But the fact that you have atoms
and that they assemble in such a willing manner is only part of what
got you here. To be here now, alive in the twenty-first century and
smart enough to know it, you also had to be the beneficiary of an
extraordinary string of biological good fortune. Survival on Earth is a
surprisingly tricky business. Of the billions and billions of species of
living things that have existed since the dawn of time, most—99.99
percent—are no longer around. Life on Earth, you see, is not only
brief but dismayingly tenuous. It is a curious feature of our existence
that we come from a planet that is very good at promoting life but
even better at extinguishing it.

The average species on Earth lasts for only about four million
years, so if you wish to be around for billions of years, you must be
as fickle as the atoms that made you. You must be prepared to change
everything about yourself—shape, size, color, species affiliation, everything—
and to do so repeatedly. That’s much easier said than done,
because the process of change is random. To get from “protoplasmal
primordial atomic globule” to sentient upright modem human has
required you to mutate new traits over and over in a precisely timely
manner for an exceedingly long while. So at various periods over the
last 3.8 billion years you have abhorred oxygen and then doted on it,
grown fins and limbs and jaunty sails, laid eggs, flicked the air with
a forked tongue, been sleek, been furry, lived underground, lived in
trees, been as big as a deer and as small as a mouse, and a million
things more. The tiniest deviation from any of these evolutionary
shifts, and you might now be licking algae from cave walls or lolling
walruslike on some stony shore or disgorging air through a blowhole
in the top of your head before diving sixty feet for a mouthful of delicious
sandworms.

Not only have you been lucky enough to be attached since time
immemorial to a favored evolutionary line, but you have also been
extremely—make that miraculously—fortunate in your personal
ancestry. Consider the fact that for 3.8 billion years, a period of
time older than the Earth’s mountains and rivers and oceans, every
one of your forebears on both sides has been attractive enough to
find a mate, healthy enough to reproduce, and sufficiently blessed
by fate and circumstances to live long enough to do so. Not one of
your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved,
stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected
from its life’s quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material
to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the
only possible sequence of hereditary
combinations that could result
—eventually, astoundingly,
and all too brieﬂy—
in you.
