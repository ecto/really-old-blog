## Who is Cam?

Who is but the form following the function of what and what I am is a man on the Internet.

## What does Cam do?

I solve problems. I create things. I dabble in the magical only to quantify it.

## What does Cam know?

I consider myself somewhat of a renaissance man, though I specialize in the digital.
Since I was young I've always been fascinated by computers and my mind tends to wander toward them.

In lieu of a rambling paragraph, I will share with you a list of my proficiencies:

- Hockey
- Photoshop
- HTML5
- CSS3
- PHP
- JavaScript
- English
- Longboarding
- Cooking pancakes
- Rolling sushi

I can do these things if I try:

- Algorithmic efficiency
- C++
- Objective-C (iPhone apps)
- Spanish
- Cooking spaghetti

And I'm learning these things right now or in the near future:

- French
- Electrical engineering
- Cooking [bananas foster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas_Foster)
