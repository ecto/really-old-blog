## Who is Cam?

Who is but the form following the function of what and what I am is a man on the Internet.

## What does Cam do?

I solve problems. I create things. I dabble in the magical only to quantify it.

## What does Cam know?

I consider myself somewhat of a renaissance man, though I specialize in the digital.
Since I was young I've always been fascinated by computers and my mind tends to wander toward them.

I can do these things in my sleep:

- Photoshop
- HTML5
- CSS3
- PHP
- JavaScript
- English
- 

I can do these things if I try:

- C++
- Objective-C (iPhone apps)
- Spanish

## What does Cam look like?

### Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me Cam.
